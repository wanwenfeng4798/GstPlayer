# gstplayer

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A cross-platform Flutter **video player** plugin that decodes local and network
video with **GStreamer** (native **C** core + **Dart FFI**) and renders into
Flutter external **`Texture`** widgets via a custom native bridge (GStreamer
`appsink` on Apple/desktop; `glimagesink` + `SurfaceProducer` on Android).

- Repository: <https://github.com/wanwenfeng4798/GstPlayer>

Supported platforms: **Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux**.

> Scope: video playback only — open / play / pause / stop / seek / volume /
> mute / speed / looping, plus state / position / duration / resolution /
> buffering / EOS / error reporting. It does **not** do recording, streaming
> (as a server), or subtitle-track selection.

## Features

- Local files, Flutter assets, and network URLs (`http(s)://`, `rtsp://`, ...).
- Play / pause / stop / seek / looping.
- Volume, mute, and playback speed control.
- Reactive state via fine-grained [`signals`]: state, position, duration, video
  size, aspect ratio, buffering %, volume, speed, looping, muted, and errors.
- A drop-in `GstVideoView` widget with a built-in, auto-hiding, themeable
  control bar (Material / Cupertino / adaptive).
- GPU-friendly video via Flutter `Texture` (Android GL into `SurfaceProducer`; Apple/desktop pixel-buffer textures fed from GStreamer `appsink`).

## Platform support

| Platform | Min version | Architectures | GStreamer runtime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | API 24 (7.0) | `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, `x86_64` | Auto-downloaded Android SDK + ndk-build at compile time |
| iOS | 13.0 | Physical `arm64` device (no Simulator) | GStreamer iOS SDK (static framework) |
| macOS | 10.13 | x86_64 / arm64 | Homebrew or `GStreamer.framework` |
| Windows | 10+ | x86_64 | GStreamer MSVC runtime |
| Linux | — | x86_64 | System GStreamer + GTK 3 |

> The Apple-Silicon iOS **Simulator** is not supported because the prebuilt iOS
> SDK does not ship an arm64 simulator slice.
>
> On Apple-Silicon macOS, the default Homebrew install is arm64-only. The plugin
> builds arm64-only in Homebrew debug mode; **Mac App Store / universal release**
> auto-downloads the official universal `GStreamer.framework` to the user cache
> during `pod install`.

## Installation

Add the package from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/gstplayer)
to your app's `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  gstplayer: ^0.0.1
```

Then:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

The native player core (`native/`) is **compiled from C** during your app build
(CMake / CocoaPods / NDK). No Rust toolchain is required. Each platform needs the
GStreamer SDK at build time (and its runtime libraries at run time where
applicable). On Android the official GStreamer Android SDK is **downloaded
automatically** on the first build and the umbrella `libgstreamer_android.so` is
produced via ndk-build (see [Android](#android-all-abis) below).

## Quick start

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:gstplayer/gstplayer.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // Kickoff only (under 50ms); gst_init continues in the background.
  // create / open / captureThumbnail await ensureReady() for you.
  unawaited(GstPlayer.initialize());
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class PlayerPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const PlayerPage({super.key});
  @override
  State<PlayerPage> createState() => _PlayerPageState();
}

class _PlayerPageState extends State<PlayerPage> {
  final controller = GstPlayerController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    controller.initialize().then((_) {
      controller.open(
        VideoSource.network('https://example.com/video.mp4'),
        autoPlay: true,
      );
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    controller.dispose(); // always dispose to release the native player
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      body: GstVideoView(controller: controller),
    );
  }
}
```

Sources can also be a local file or a bundled asset:

```dart
await controller.open(const VideoSource.file('/path/to/video.mp4'));
await controller.open(const VideoSource.asset('assets/sample.mp4'));
```

Bundled assets are loaded via Dart FFI bytes into a native temp file (not AppSrc).

## Integrating into your app (read this first)

1. **Start `GstPlayer.initialize()` once** early (typically in `main()`
   after `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`). Prefer
   `unawaited(GstPlayer.initialize()); runApp(...);` — kickoff is
   under 50ms and does not wait for `gst_init`. Use
   `GstPlayer.ensureReady()` only if you need a hard wait; controller
   `create` / `captureThumbnail` already await it. Idempotent and safe after a
   hot restart.
2. **Create and `initialize()` a `GstPlayerController` per video surface.** The
   controller owns a native player; it is created during `initialize()`.
3. **Always `dispose()` the controller** when the surface goes away — this stops
   the pipeline, cancels the event stream, and releases native resources. Leaking
   a controller leaks a native pipeline.
4. **Read state inside `SignalBuilder`/`Watch`.** Every state field is a
   `ReadonlySignal`; reading `.value` outside a reactive builder will not rebuild
   your widget when it changes.
5. **Android builds all four ABIs by default** (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`,
   `x86_64`). You may optionally narrow this with `abiFilters` to shrink your APK
   (see below). The first Android build downloads the GStreamer Android SDK and
   runs ndk-build (requires network).
6. **All platforms require the GStreamer SDK at build time** (and its runtime
   libraries at run time where applicable). See
   [Native GStreamer setup](#native-gstreamer-setup-per-platform).

## Permissions & platform configuration

Playback of **network** video requires per-platform configuration. Local files
and assets work with no extra permissions (aside from normal file access).

### Android

Add the internet permission to your app's
`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (outside `<application>`):

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

To allow plaintext `http://` (Android blocks cleartext by default on API 28+),
set `usesCleartextTraffic` on `<application>`:

```xml
<application
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
    ...>
```

The plugin ships all four ABIs (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, `x86_64`), so
no `abiFilters` are required. If you want to shrink your APK to only the ABIs you
ship, narrow the set in `android/app/build.gradle(.kts)`:

```kotlin
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ndk {
            // Optional: keep only the ABIs you need (arm64-v8a covers most
            // modern phones; x86_64 is useful for emulators).
            abiFilters += listOf("arm64-v8a", "x86_64")
        }
    }
}
```

Prefer per-ABI APKs or an Android App Bundle so each device only downloads its
own ABI — the GStreamer runtime packaged per ABI is large (~13–18 MB each).

> The plugin ships `x86` (32-bit) libraries for completeness, but current Flutter
> no longer builds 32-bit x86 apps, so in practice `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`,
> and `x86_64` are what a Flutter app will actually package.

Notes:

- The plugin's `AndroidManifest.xml` already sets
  `android:extractNativeLibs="true"`; it merges into your app so
  `libgstreamer_android.so` is extracted to disk for the dynamic loader.
- Some transitive plugins require a recent `compileSdk`. If AAR metadata checks
  fail, force `compileSdk = 36` across subprojects (the example does this in its
  `android/build.gradle.kts`).

#### Release builds (R8 / ProGuard)

Video renders into a Flutter **`Texture`** backed by `SurfaceProducer`; GStreamer
`glimagesink` binds via `VideoOverlay` to the producer's `Surface`. The plugin
ships consumer ProGuard rules in its AAR
(`android/proguard-rules.pro`). Keep GStreamer JNI helpers:

```proguard
-keep class org.freedesktop.gstreamer.** { *; }
```

Ensure your `release` build type references `proguard-rules.pro` when
`isMinifyEnabled = true`.

**v1.4.0+** uses Flutter external textures on all platforms (custom bridge, no
`irondash_texture`). Android keeps the
[GStreamer Android video tutorial](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/android/video.html)
`glimagesink` + `ANativeWindow` path via `SurfaceProducer`.

**v1.0.19+** fixes Android SIGABRT by adopting the GStreamer Android tutorial
thread model: a dedicated `gstp-gst` thread with an **owned** `GMainContext`
(`MainContext::new()`, not `default()`), `MainLoop::run()`, and all pipeline
operations marshalled onto that thread.

**v1.0.18** (superseded by 1.0.19) attempted a default-context `GMainLoop`; do
not use.

**v1.0.17+** streams network `http(s)://` URIs directly through GStreamer
(`playbin3` / `souphttpsrc`); the plugin does **not** download to disk first.

**v1.0.16+** when `gst_is_initialized()` is already true: syncs gstreamer-rs state
and does **not** call GLib thread-default APIs on the Flutter main thread.
Prefer a ready `localPath` from your media layer when available.

**v1.0.11+** runs the entire `create_player` path on the Android main thread (fixes
crashes when FRB calls from a worker thread) and no longer calls
`android_logger::init_once` (safe alongside host SDKs such as `gstplayer_sdk` that
already own the global `log` logger). Panics are written via `__android_log_write`
(`gstplayer` tag).

**v1.0.10+** additionally hardens frame upload (no `assert!` on buffer size
mismatch), refreshes `ANativeWindow` in `onSurfaceAvailable`, and logs Rust panic
backtraces to logcat (`gstplayer` tag). If the app still crashes,
build with a clean tree and symbolicate with
[`scripts/symbolicate_android_tombstone.sh`](scripts/symbolicate_android_tombstone.sh).

### Consumer integration checklist (e.g. chat / IM apps)

1. **Plugin version** — use **1.4.0+** for Texture rendering; run
   `flutter clean` / full reinstall after upgrading.
2. **Initialization order** — kick off `GstPlayer.initialize()` (prefer
   overlapping with first frame; under 50ms) → `controller.initialize()` (awaits
   `ensureReady`) → wait until media is on disk → `open(...)`.
3. **Video surface** — embed `GstVideoView` (set `showControls: false` if you
   provide your own chrome). The widget registers a native texture automatically.
4. **Release builds** — keep ProGuard rules that merge from this plugin's AAR.
5. **Diagnosis** — filter logcat for `gstplayer` and `android overlay:`.

### iOS

- **Minimum deployment target: iOS 13.0.** Physical `arm64` device only (no
  Simulator).
- GStreamer performs networking with its own sockets + OpenSSL, **not** through
  `NSURLSession`, so App Transport Security (ATS) does **not** block playback and
  no `NSAppTransportSecurity` entry is required for GStreamer streams (both
  `http://` and `https://` work).
- The static iOS framework's plugins and TLS backend are registered in the C
  core (`native/src/ios_plugins.c`, `native/src/ios_tls.c`, called from
  `native/src/runtime.c`). HTTPS certificate
  verification is intentionally relaxed (`ssl-strict = false`) so streams from
  hosts without a bundled CA chain still play — see the
  [security note](#security-note-on-https).

### macOS

The Mac App Store requires **App Sandbox**. At runtime the C core configures
`GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH` and `GIO_MODULE_DIR` for the embedded framework.

**Important:** when Flutter integrates this plugin via **Swift Package Manager**
(SPM — default when `Package.swift` is present), CocoaPods
`vendored_frameworks` does **not** run, so GStreamer is **not** copied into the
`.app` automatically. Without an embed step you get:

```text
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0/lib/GStreamer
```

#### Embed GStreamer (required for SPM hosts with a Podfile)

In `macos/Podfile`, resolve the plugin and call the helper from `post_install`:

```ruby
require 'json'
plugins = JSON.parse(File.read(File.expand_path('../.flutter-plugins-dependencies', __dir__)))
gstp = plugins.dig('plugins', 'macos')&.find { |p| p['name'] == 'gstplayer' }
raise 'gstplayer not found; run flutter pub get first' unless gstp
require File.expand_path('macos/gstreamer_podfile_helper.rb', gstp['path'])

# ...

post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    flutter_additional_macos_build_settings(target)
  end
  install_gstreamer_embed_script!(installer)
end
```

Then `cd macos && pod install`. This adds an Xcode Run Script that copies the
slim runtime into `YourApp.app/Contents/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework`.

Pure-SPM apps without a Podfile (this repo’s `example`): keep the existing
Runner Run Script that calls `macos/scripts/embed_gstreamer_framework.sh`.

Add at minimum to `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and
`Release.entitlements`:

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
```

See [Mac App Store release (macOS)](#mac-app-store-release-macos) for the full
checklist.

For local dev without the official framework, set
`GSTPLAYER_ALLOW_HOMEBREW_GSTREAMER=1` (not suitable for store submission).

### Apple Release / FFI symbols (iOS & macOS)

On Apple platforms Dart loads the C player via `DynamicLibrary.process()` and
resolves `gstp_*` with `dlsym`. Release / Archive builds can strip those global
symbols, which surfaces as:

```text
Failed to lookup symbol 'gstp_init': dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, gstp_init): symbol not found
```

The plugin already:

- Marks ABI exports `__attribute__((used))` and calls `gstp_ffi_retain_symbols()`
  from plugin registration (keeps symbols past dead-code strip).
- CocoaPods: injects Runner `-force_load` of `libgstplayer.a` and
  `STRIP_STYLE=non-global` via `user_target_xcconfig`.

Host apps still need **Strip Style = Non-Global Symbols** so `dlsym` can see
global names after Archive. See also
[Flutter C interop — Stripping symbols](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/ios/c-interop).

| Integration | Do you need to set Strip Style manually? |
| --- | --- |
| **CocoaPods** (typical Flutter apps with a `Podfile`) | Usually **no**. After upgrading this plugin, run `cd ios && pod install` and/or `cd macos && pod install`. Confirm Runner → Build Settings → Strip Style is **Non-Global Symbols** for Release/Profile. |
| **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** | **Yes.** Podspec settings do not apply. Configure Xcode as below. This repo’s `example` already sets `STRIP_STYLE = non-global`. |

#### SPM / manual Xcode steps

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` or `macos/Runner.xcworkspace`.
2. Select target **Runner** → **Build Settings**.
3. Search **Strip Style** (or `STRIP_STYLE`).
4. For **Release** and **Profile**, change **All Symbols** → **Non-Global Symbols**.
5. Clean and rebuild: `flutter build ios --release` / `flutter build macos --release`
   (or Archive).

Or add to the Release/Profile blocks in `project.pbxproj`:

```
STRIP_STYLE = non-global;
```

#### Verify symbols are present

```bash
# macOS Release .app
nm -gU YourApp.app/Contents/MacOS/YourApp | grep gstp_init

# iOS (Runner binary inside the .app)
nm -gU Runner.app/Runner | grep gstp_init
```

You should see `_gstp_init`. An empty result means symbols were still stripped.

#### SPM NativeCore (C sources)

SPM builds the C core from `ios|macos/gstplayer/NativeCore/`, which
must be a **real copy** of `native/` (not a directory symlink). Publishing with
symlinks produced path-text stubs on pub.dev and linker errors
(`undefined symbol: _gstp_*`). After changing C code:

```bash
./tool/sync_native_core.sh
./tool/verify_native_core.sh
```

### Windows

- Install the GStreamer **MSVC** package (development files + runtime) from
  <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/>.
- Ensure the runtime DLLs are discoverable at run time — add
  `...\1.0\msvc_x86_64\bin` to `PATH` or bundle the DLLs next to your `.exe`.
- Plugin DLLs live under `lib\gstreamer-1.0`; when packaging, point
  `GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH` at the bundled copy at startup.

### Linux

- No app permission is required. Install the system GStreamer development and
  plugin packages plus GTK 3 (see [Native setup](#linux-1)).

### Security note on HTTPS

To maximize compatibility with hosts whose certificate chains are not present in
the (minimal) bundled trust store, the pipeline sets `ssl-strict = false` on the
HTTP source, which **skips server-certificate verification**. This removes
protection against man-in-the-middle attacks. If you need strict verification,
bundle a CA certificate database and configure GLib's default `GTlsDatabase`
(open an issue if you want this made configurable).

## API reference

### `GstPlayer.initialize()`

Kickoff-only: opens the native library and starts background `gst_init` /
FFI worker spawn. Target under 50ms; does **not** wait for runtime readiness.
Call early (e.g. before `runApp`). Idempotent; concurrent calls share one
`Future`. After return, `isInitialized` may still be `false`.

### `GstPlayer.ensureReady()`

Awaits full runtime readiness (`gst_init` success + worker started). Starts
`initialize()` if needed. Controller `create` and `captureThumbnail` call this
automatically.

### `GstPlayer.captureThumbnail(VideoSource, {Duration? at, int maxWidth})`

One-shot cover extraction via a headless GStreamer pipeline in C
(`gstp_thumbnail_capture`). Returns PNG `Uint8List`. Does not require an open
controller. When `at` is null, native picks ~5% of duration (or 1s).

### `GstPlayerController`

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `initialize()` | Creates the native player and subscribes to events. |
| `open(VideoSource, {bool autoPlay})` | Loads a source; optionally starts playback. |
| `play()` / `pause()` / `stop()` | Playback transport. |
| `togglePlayPause()` | Play if paused, pause if playing. |
| `seek(Duration)` | Seek to a position. |
| `setVolume(double)` | Volume in `0.0..1.0`. |
| `setMuted(bool)` / `toggleMuted()` | Mute control. |
| `setSpeed(double)` | Playback speed multiplier. |
| `setLooping(bool)` | Loop at end-of-stream. |
| `captureCurrentFrame()` | Latest decoded frame as PNG (`gstp_player_capture_frame`). |
| `queryPosition()` / `queryDuration()` | Query the pipeline directly. |
| `dispose()` | Tear down the player and release all resources. |

Reactive state (all `ReadonlySignal`s; read `.value` in a `SignalBuilder`):
`state`, `position`, `duration`, `videoSize`, `aspectRatio`, `bufferingPercent`,
`volume`, `speed`, `looping`, `muted`, `isPlaying`, `isCompleted`, `error`,
`playerId`, `initialized`.

`PlayerState`: `idle`, `ready`, `buffering`, `playing`, `paused`, `stopped`,
`completed`, `error`.

### `VideoSource`

- `VideoSource.network(String url)`
- `VideoSource.file(String path)` (accepts a plain path or a `file://` URI)
- `VideoSource.asset(String assetKey)`

### `GstVideoView`

A `StatelessWidget` that embeds a Flutter `Texture` for the controller's video and,
by default, an adaptive control bar.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `controller` | required | The `GstPlayerController` to render. |
| `aspectRatioMode` | `AspectRatioMode.fit` | GStreamer sink scaling (`fit` / `fill` / `stretch`). Also available via `controller.setAspectRatioMode`. |
| `backgroundColor` | black | Letterbox / background color. |
| `showControls` | `true` | Overlay the built-in control bar. |
| `controlsStyle` | `adaptive` | `adaptive` / `material` / `cupertino`. |

### Theming the controls

Register a `VideoControlsTheme` in `ThemeData.extensions` to customize the
control bar, or rely on the built-in `VideoControlsTheme.material()` /
`VideoControlsTheme.cupertino()` presets:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  theme: ThemeData(
    extensions: const [/* your */ VideoControlsTheme.material()],
  ),
);
```

## Native GStreamer setup (per platform)

The Rust core links GStreamer at build time, so a GStreamer **development**
install must be discoverable while building, and the runtime libraries must be
available (bundled or system-installed) when running.

### macOS

**Mac App Store / sandboxed release** requires the official universal
`GStreamer.framework` (x86_64 + arm64). Homebrew dylibs cannot be loaded from
`/opt/homebrew` inside the sandbox.

On first `pod install`, runtime + devel are **downloaded automatically** into the
user cache (~**800MB–1GB** download, no sudo):

`~/Library/Caches/gstplayer/gstreamer/1.28.5/`
  - `GStreamer.framework` — full SDK (for build/link)
  - `GStreamerRuntime.framework` — runtime snapshot (embedded into `.app`; consumers
    do not need to configure this)

The final `.app` embeds a trimmed **Slim Runtime** (v1.0.5+, ~**350–450MB**
universal, or ~**175–280MB** per-arch) with only the plugins needed for playbin3,
HTTPS/HLS/RTSP, and applemedia hardware decode. Multiple Flutter projects share
the same download cache.

Optional per-arch builds: set `GSTPLAYER_GSTREAMER_ARCH=arm64` or `x86_64` before
`pod install` / `flutter build macos` (default `universal`) to ship separate Apple
Silicon and Intel packages.

Optional env vars: `GSTPLAYER_GSTREAMER_ROOT`, `GSTREAMER_FRAMEWORK_SRC` (offline /
custom paths). Maintainers may still run `sh tool/setup_gstreamer_macos.sh
--system` to install under `/Library/Frameworks`.

#### Consumers: build setup

1. Enable App Sandbox + `com.apple.security.network.client` (see
   [Permissions](#permissions--platform-configuration)).
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Wire the GStreamer embed helper into `macos/Podfile` `post_install` (see
   [macOS](#macos) — **required under SPM**), then `cd macos && pod install`
   (first run downloads the GStreamer cache if needed).
4. Run `flutter build macos --release` and verify
   `YourApp.app/Contents/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework` exists:

```bash
ls YourApp.app/Contents/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Versions/1.0/lib/GStreamer
```

If that path is missing, dyld will fail at launch with
`Library not loaded: @rpath/GStreamer.framework/...`.

The C core sets `GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH`, `GIO_MODULE_DIR`, and a writable
`GST_REGISTRY` before `gst_init()` (`gstp_setup_macos_env()` in
`native/src/apple_env.c`).

#### Local Homebrew dev (not for MAS)

```bash
export GSTPLAYER_ALLOW_HOMEBREW_GSTREAMER=1
brew install pkg-config gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-libav
```

### Mac App Store release (macOS)

1. Enable sandbox + `network.client` in `macos/Runner/*entitlements`.
2. `flutter build macos --release` or Archive in Xcode (first build downloads
   the GStreamer cache automatically).
3. Verify:
   - `YourApp.app/Contents/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework` is present
   - `codesign -vvv --deep --strict YourApp.app` passes
   - Network playback works with sandbox enabled
4. Validate App → Upload to App Store Connect.

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav \
  libgtk-3-dev
```

Runtime uses the system GStreamer libraries. `libgtk-3-dev` is required for
Flutter Linux texture registration (GTK/GL interop in the engine).

### Windows

> GStreamer 1.28+ ships a single **Inno Setup `.exe`** installer (the older
> `.msi` packages, including the separate `-devel` package, were removed). One
> installer bundles both runtime and development files.

1. Download `gstreamer-1.0-msvc-x86_64-<version>.exe` (the MSVC build) from
   <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/> and run it. Choose the
   **"Runtime and development headers"** setup type so the headers/`.lib`/`.pc`
   files are installed.
2. The GUI installer sets `GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_MSVC_X86_64`, which
   `windows/CMakeLists.txt` uses to locate headers/libs and to bundle the runtime
   DLLs next to the app. (In headless/silent installs this variable may not be
   set reliably — set it manually if needed.)
3. A `pkg-config` must be on `PATH` (e.g. `choco install pkgconfiglite`).
4. Plugin DLLs live under `lib/gstreamer-1.0`; set `GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH` to
   the bundled copy at startup when packaging.

### iOS (physical device)

Targets a physical arm64 iPhone. The prebuilt SDK does not ship an arm64
Simulator slice, so the Apple-Silicon iOS Simulator is not supported.

1. Download and install the **GStreamer iOS SDK** (`devel`), matching your
   desktop GStreamer major/minor version:

   ```bash
   curl -fLO https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/ios/1.28.5/gstreamer-1.0-devel-1.28.5-ios-universal.pkg
   # user-domain install (no sudo); double-clicking the .pkg also works
   installer -pkg gstreamer-1.0-devel-1.28.5-ios-universal.pkg -target CurrentUserHomeDirectory
   ```

   This installs `GStreamer.framework` under
   `~/Library/Developer/GStreamer/iPhone.sdk` (override with `GSTREAMER_ROOT_IOS`).
2. `ios/gstplayer.podspec` already exports the `system-deps` overrides
   and `PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1` for the Rust cross-build, injects `RUSTFLAGS` via
   `ios/scripts/ios_rust_link_flags.sh` (UIKit/OpenGLES/QuartzCore, etc. for the
   Cargokit staticlib link step), and links the umbrella `-framework GStreamer`
   in `OTHER_LDFLAGS` for the final Xcode link.
3. Build/run on a connected device: `flutter run -d <device>` (or
   `flutter build ios --no-codesign` to verify the build).

Because the iOS `GStreamer.framework` is static, its plugins are not
auto-discovered. The C core registers the ones needed for playback and the
OpenSSL TLS backend (`gstp_register_ios_static_plugins()` /
`gstp_register_ios_tls_backend()` in `native/src/runtime.c`, iOS-only), and
prepares the runtime environment before `gst_init()`. Add to the plugin list in
`native/src/ios_plugins.c` if you need an element that isn't registered yet.

### Android (all ABIs)

Supports `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, and `x86_64`. On every Android
build the plugin:

1. Downloads the official GStreamer Android universal SDK (if not already cached)
2. Runs ndk-build to produce the umbrella `libgstreamer_android.so` per ABI
3. Compiles the C `libgstplayer.so` via NDK CMake (`native/` + JNI)

The umbrella library (all of GStreamer + its plugins, linked statically) and
`libc++_shared.so` land in `android/build/gstreamer/jniLibs/<abi>/` and are
packaged into the plugin AAR. **The first build needs network access**; later
builds reuse the cache at
`~/Library/Caches/gstplayer/gstreamer/android/<version>/`.

Environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GST_VER` | GStreamer version (default `1.28.5`) |
| `GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID` | SDK root (skip auto-download when pre-populated) |
| `GSTPLAYER_GSTREAMER_ROOT` | Alias for custom SDK/cache root |

The GStreamer Android runtime is initialized automatically at process startup by
`GStreamerInitProvider` (a `ContentProvider` in the plugin's
`android/src/main/java/`), which runs `System.loadLibrary("gstreamer_android")`
(so the library's `JNI_OnLoad` captures the JavaVM) and `GStreamer.init(context)`
(so the app `Context`/`ClassLoader` are set). This is required so the
`androidmedia` MediaCodec decoders can enumerate/register - without it playback
fails with `not-linked` / `No streams to output`. The Rust core does NOT register
plugins on Android (it would run before the Java init and without the JavaVM).

A consuming app builds for all four ABIs by default. To reduce APK size, narrow
`abiFilters` (see [Permissions & platform configuration](#android)) or ship an
App Bundle.

#### Customizing the plugin set

Edit `GSTREAMER_PLUGINS` in
[`android/gstreamer_build/jni/Android.mk`](android/gstreamer_build/jni/Android.mk)
to add codecs, then rebuild. The next Android build regenerates the umbrella
libraries automatically.

#### Manual SDK / umbrella rebuild (optional)

Gradle runs
[`android/scripts/ensure_gstreamer_android.sh`](android/scripts/ensure_gstreamer_android.sh)
and
[`android/scripts/build_gstreamer_umbrella.sh`](android/scripts/build_gstreamer_umbrella.sh)
for you. To run them by hand:

```bash
sh android/scripts/ensure_gstreamer_android.sh
sh android/scripts/build_gstreamer_umbrella.sh \
  "$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/<ndk-version>" \
  /tmp/gstreamer-jniLibs \
  arm64-v8a armeabi-v7a x86 x86_64
```

## Architecture

```
Dart:  GstPlayerController ──FFI──► FfiPlayerCommandPort (gstp_player_*)
       GstVideoView (Texture) ◄──native texture── GStreamer sink
C:     native/ playbin3 ─► appsink (Apple/desktop) or glimagesink (Android)
                     │ bus ─► GstpEventCallback ─► Dart Stream
```

- Decoding: `playbin3` with platform video sink (`appsink` or `glimagesink`).
- Rendering: Flutter `Texture` + native `TextureRegistry`; Android uses
  `SurfaceProducer` + VideoOverlay; Apple/desktop pull BGRA frames via C ABI
  (`gstp_texture_*`).
- Control plane: Dart FFI → narrow `gstp_player_*` API (see `native/include/gstp_player.h`).

### Regenerating FFI bindings

After changing `native/include/gstp_player.h`:

```bash
dart run ffigen --config ffigen.yaml
```

### GStreamer upstream patches

When GStreamer C itself must change, use the
[Matkurban/gstreamer](https://github.com/Matkurban/gstreamer) fork as the patch
source (`GSTP_GSTREAMER_SRC`). See [third_party/gstreamer.md](third_party/gstreamer.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **Release crash: `Failed to lookup symbol 'gstp_init'` (iOS/macOS only):**
  global FFI symbols were stripped. See
  [Apple Release / FFI symbols](#apple-release--ffi-symbols-ios--macos)
  (Strip Style = Non-Global Symbols; CocoaPods usually injects this after
  `pod install`).
- **Link error: `undefined symbol: _gstp_*` (SPM macOS/iOS):**
  `NativeCore` C tree missing or corrupted (pub symlink stubs). For a path
  dependency run `./tool/sync_native_core.sh` then `flutter clean` and rebuild.
  See [SPM NativeCore](#spm-nativecore-c-sources).
- **iOS launch `g_dir_open_with_errno` / `g_filename_to_utf8` / ORC mmap errors:**
  GLib/GStreamer need writable `HOME`/`XDG_*`/`GST_REGISTRY`, ORC JIT is blocked
  by the Hardened Runtime, and static iOS builds must not scan a NULL plugin
  path. The C core sets these before `gst_init` (`native/src/apple_env.c`:
  `ORC_CODE=backup`, empty `GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH`). Do not add `allow-jit`.
- **`Can't typefind stream` / `Stream doesn't contain enough data` on network
  video (iOS):** usually a failed TLS handshake when no CA database is
  configured. The C core registers the OpenSSL TLS backend
  (`native/src/ios_tls.c`) and relaxes `ssl-strict` on `souphttpsrc` via
  playbin `source-setup`.
- **APK too large:** all four Android ABIs each carry a large GStreamer runtime.
  Narrow `abiFilters` or ship per-ABI APKs / an App Bundle.
- **Android first build fails / no network:** the GStreamer Android SDK is
  downloaded on first build. Pre-populate `GSTREAMER_ROOT_ANDROID` for offline
  CI, or cache `~/Library/Caches/gstplayer/gstreamer/android/`.
- **Windows `pkg-config` cannot find `glib-2.0`:** confirm the **development**
  files were installed and `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` points at
  `...\1.0\msvc_x86_64\lib\pkgconfig`.
- **macOS black screen / dyld cannot load GStreamer:** confirm
  `.app/Contents/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework` exists. Under SPM this requires
  `install_gstreamer_embed_script!(installer)` in `macos/Podfile` `post_install`
  (see [macOS](#macos)), then `pod install` and rebuild. Enable sandbox
  `network.client`; for Homebrew-only dev set
  `GSTPLAYER_ALLOW_HOMEBREW_GSTREAMER=1` (store builds require the official
  framework).
